  <h1>toki ma was good, wasn't it?</h1>
  <p summary>toki pona is a good conlang. toki ma, an offshoot of the toki pona project, was also really good because it was based on the same principles but operated on a more practical edge. Then toki ma separated itself from toki pona.</p>
  <h2>toki pona is really good</h2>
  <p>I'm not here to convince you of the self-evident truth that <a href="https://tokipona.org/">toki pona</a> is a cool language to use. I think everybody should try learning it: it's fun! kama sona e toki pona la ale li kama pona!</p>
  <p>It's a constructed language with the goal of expressing the breadth of human thought using as few words as possible. toki pona has 137 words, basically. To express anything not captured in any of these words, you compound words! "school" is translated as "tomo sona", or "kulupu sona", or something like that. It all depends on what a school means to <em>you, yes you, personally</em>.</p>
  <p>Context and subjectivity are important in toki pona communication. I would argue they are important in all communication, and toki pona just brings it to your attention because of the limits of the medium.</p>
  <p>I think that the thesis of toki pona, deconstructing ideas into their meaningful parts, is a really fun exercise. It is meaningful because toki pona has so few words.</p>
  <p>Another facet of toki pona I really like is that words float between word classes! "sona" is a noun, adjective, and verb all at once, not in 3-way ambiguity but in one vague cloud floating over all the word classes. Lojban does this too, but people who think brivla are just verbs aren't ready to hear this.</p>
  <h2>137 isn't really enough</h2>
  <p>I think 137 words is plenty for the way toki pona is practically used. But of course, if you were to imagine documents with any amount of technical language (contracts, laws, scientific records), toki pona just couldn't do it.</p>
  <p>You don't just coin new toki pona words the same way you do for English. Every single new word would disrupt the ecosystem of toki pona words, the way they're used, the way they're seen in relation to each other. New words doesn't really happen.</p>
  <p>Some people make offshoot languages of toki pona, <em>tokiponidos</em>, which aim to revise toki pona in one way or another. Adding words is a typical goal. toki ma is one such tokiponido.</p>
  <h2>I liked toki ma</h2>
  <p>toki ma upped the word count to around 300. One chart I saw has 289, and a more current resource has 361 words. Either way, 300 words seems more reasonable to me. Each addition they made still feels very true to the philosophy of toki pona, while pushing toki pona to be more practical.</p>
  <p>I liked the word "aja" (means "life"). I found myself accidentally using it when writing in toki pona, because "aja" fits so naturally in the toki pona lexicon. Ordinarily, you would have to translate life as "ale", but that doesn't really capture the aspect of being a live organism. "lon" is also sometimes used here. But I don't think any combination of "ale" and "lon" can convey what "aja" expresses.</p>
  <p>Other words like "oke" ("accept"), "ajuta" ("help"), and "soto" ("sort/kind/type") were really useful in a way I don't think the original 137 can accomplish.</p>
  <p>A lot of them did feel unecessary. Turning "wile" into "wile" and "pesoni" (and "ukumu" and "kokan") feels counter to the spirit of toki pona.</p>
  <p>But in general, I liked it. It felt like toki pona in an alternate universe where 300 was a more reasonable number than 137. I could see normal people expressing themselves in 300 words, whereas it takes a nerd to like the challenge of 137.</p>
  <p>Oh, and I didn't like how toki ma tried to more strongly delineate word classes. That wasn't cute. Its point was to clarify how changing word classes influences the meaning (e.g. when a verb becomes a noun, the noun is a typical object of the verb) (this is very Lojban style, eh? 'lo se [brivla]'?). But I still don't like it. Don't tell me what part of speech my words are!</p>
  <p>toki ma was cute! They really incorporated the "toki pona-but-more" identity. They made their own sitelen pona, their own dictionaries. It was backwards compatible (lol). I sometimes saw toki ma alongside toki pona in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/prolangs/">r/prolangs comics</a>.</p>
  <h2>Kokanu</h2>
  <p>A while ago, toki ma wanted to pivot away from its toki pona origins. The community replaced all words kept over from toki pona with all-new words. Thus the language became <a href="https://www.kokanu.com/">Kokanu</a>. They later overhauled all vocabulary by adding /h/ and /tʃ/ ⟨c⟩ (a postalveolar affricate, I know, right!?).</p>
  <p>They made their own orthography, which is technically an abugida, but entirely by reusing characters that are common in lots of IPA-compatible fonts. I'm sorry, but insisting ⟨xʃxƨſ⟩ in fact spells "Kokanu" is really funny to me. Those are alternate Roman characters used in unorthodox ways, what are you doing?</p>
  <p>They also added a lot of grammatical particles, not for useful things, but for pretty minute grammatical considerations. Various types of clause markers and clause enders, it's like the Lojbanists got their hands on it. I'm actually really impressed with the elegance and efficiency of toki pona's particles li/e/o, en/anu, ala, la, and pi. I think comparative particles, and maybe even relative clause particles were in order (sorry! I keep accidentally saying "ki" as if this were French). Kokanu implemented this, but they implemented too much more as well.</p>
  <p>I don't like these changes, but it might just be nostalgia for its old identity of "toki pona-but-more". I don't like that Kokanu now looks utterly foreign.</p>
  <p>I was really fond of toki ma a few years ago. When toki pona was getting popular on social media, and it felt like a meaningful movement of internet users learning a fun language together, toki ma felt like the obvious accomodation for people who aren't comfortable with only 137 words. It was such a great expansion on toki pona. But Kokanu is no longer an expansion on toki pona, it's its own thing now. It's an alright thing that doesn't really carry any of toki pona's momentum any more.</p>
  <p>toki pona is a really good conlang. So is Kokanu, mostly thanks to how ingenius the premise of toki ma (as a tokiponido) was.</p>
