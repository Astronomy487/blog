    <div comment>[may 15 2024]</div>
    <p summary>The Planck units are a coherent set of units based on universal constants ($c$, $G$, $\hbar$, $k_B$). In using them, you have to express all quantities (like mass, length, time) in terms of multiplication/division of those constants. I find it hilarious that you can measure normal-looking physical quantities, like energy or acceleration, using these. I mess around with other coherent measurement systems, taking advantage of linear algebra shenanigans.</p>

    <p summary>toki pona is a good conlang. toki ma, an offshoot of the toki pona project, was also really good because it was based on the same principles but operated on a more practical edge. Then toki ma separated itself from toki pona.</p>

    <a href="basisfunctions">What are the basis functions?</a>
    <div comment>[may 2 2024]</div>
    <p summary>I've been thinking about making bases for funny vector spaces: all functions, or all smooth functions, or all continuous functions. I mess around with the idea of creating a non-analytic function out of linearly combining infinitely many analytic functions; this doesn't violate the vector space axioms, it's just strange that you can sometimes-but-not-always perform infinite linear combinations and stay in the vector space.</p>

    <div comment>[april 12 2024]</div>
    <p summary>Cantor proved that $|\mathbb{R}|>|\mathbb{Z}|$ ($\frak{c}>\aleph_0$) in one of my favorite proofs of all time. The difference between these two infinities can be intuited, I think. But $\frak{c}$ is so monsterously large that you cannot possibly care about something of that size; the set of things that can be conceived of in any capacity is horrifyingly only $\aleph_0$, dare I say finite, even all your favorite irrationals which you usually concede as belonging to the realm of $\frak{c}$.</p>
