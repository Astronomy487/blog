    <div comment>[may 2 2024]</div>
    <p summary>I've been thinking about making bases for funny vector spaces: all functions, or all smooth functions, or all continuous functions. I mess around with the idea of creating a non-analytic function out of linearly combining infinitely many analytic functions; this doesn't violate the vector space axioms, it's just strange that you can sometimes-but-not-always perform infinite linear combinations and stay in the vector space.</p>

    <p summary>Cantor proved that $|\mathbb{R}|>|\mathbb{Z}|$ ($\frak{c}>\aleph_0$) in one of my favorite proofs of all time. The difference between these two infinities can be intuited, I think. But $\frak{c}$ is so monsterously large that you cannot possibly care about something of that size; the set of things that can be conceived of in any capacity is horrifyingly only $\aleph_0$, dare I say finite, even all your favorite irrationals which you usually concede as belonging to the realm of $\frak{c}$.</p>
